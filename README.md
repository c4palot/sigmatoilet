Funny Maud Sparkle
A Short Story
by Kinito

Maud Sparkle had always loved deprived Madrid with its jealous, jittery jungle. It was a place where she felt anxious.

She was a funny, rizzy, tea drinker with short abs and sloppy moles. Her friends saw her as a rainy, resonant rover. Once, she had even helped a fantastic deaf person recover from a flying accident. That's the sort of woman he was.

Maud walked over to the window and reflected on her sunny surroundings. The sleet rained like bopping gerbils.

Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Cameron Fish. Cameron was a tight-fisted ogre with solid abs and vast moles.

Maud gulped. She was not prepared for Cameron.

As Maud stepped outside and Cameron came closer, she could see the alive glint in his eye.

Cameron gazed with the affection of 5276 special flipping frogs. He said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want to goon."

Maud looked back, even more active and still fingering the giant torch. "Cameron, I am gonna buss," she replied.

They looked at each other with happy feelings, like two tough, tasty tortoises jumping at a very gracious engagement party, which had orchestral music playing in the background and two brave uncles laughing to the beat.

Maud regarded Cameron's solid abs and vast moles. "I feel the same way!" revealed Maud with a delighted grin.

Cameron looked concerned, his emotions blushing like a tasty, tart teapot.

Then Cameron came inside for a nice edging sesh.
THE END
